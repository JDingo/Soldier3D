# Soldier3D
A web page displaying a 3D model. The web page uses Three.js, a JavaScript 3D library, to display the model on the page.

## Purpose
This project serves as a practical work for upper secondary school. Personal objectives for this project were to learn basics about 3D modelling and animation, and website coding.

## Implementation
The 3D model and its animations were made using Blender. The model was then exported into a format compatible with Three.js. The website is basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and the 3D viewer for the model is implemented using Three.js-library.
